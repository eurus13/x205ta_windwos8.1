# x205ta_windwos8.1

Message if you need help with a similar issue. I can share instructions to make Win8.1 Bing ISO w/asus x205ta touchpad/keyboard drivers 

------------


No one probably needs this anymore .. but the Asus X205ta laptop came with Win 8.1 installed with a small eMMC drive that 
I whad to wipe the recovery partition to even have enough room to install bare Win 10. 

Needing to restore my computer and W10 being useless for me there .. and unable to find any other option I had to find a
special version of Win8- Win8 Bing Edition that came installed and roll my x205Ta drivers into the Win8.iso so I could run 
the install since there was no mouse or keyboard due default driver compatibility issues.
